  This page details what our team did for our final project in CSC 3220 Fundamentals of Data Science at Tennessee Tech University. The dataset we used can be obtained from the following link: [adult-census-income](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income)


The main goal of this project was to use different classification techniques to find which one had the highest accuracy in predicting which income bracket the individual would fall into based on his or her other features. In order to do this we had to do some data cleaning. The first step in our data cleaning was to get rid of any people that had left values empty. Then in order to allow our classifications to use all of the columns in our data set we began converting them into numeric data types, essentially assigning categorical numbers to each response for each column. The associated number values for each column as well as the download for our cleaned data set can be found [here](https://austinatchley1.github.io/Data-Science-Team-Project/Data-Cleaning.html).
